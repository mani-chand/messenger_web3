# messenger_web3
This is my first smart contract.
messenger has a solidity contract called messenger. It was deployed using thirdweb https://thirdweb.com/goerli/0x153810e345CA1Aca25651bEf463726AA3ccE02b0.
Only create account,send message,noOfUsers,users,conversationId,chat are working properly.Remaining have bugs in functions and the logic is missing.
